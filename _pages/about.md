I am full Professor of Economics at the Department of Economic Science at Universit√† di Bologna. I am interested in Empirical Macroeconomics, Applied Times Series and Monetary Economics.

Prior to that, I was a senior economist on the macroeconomics team in the economic research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago where I am currently on leave. In that position, I provided research and analysis on macroeconomics and applied econometrics.

Prior to joining the Fed, I was economist at the Banque de France and at the European Commission. I obtained a B.A. from Bocconi University, Milan (Italy), and an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in economics from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona (Spain).
